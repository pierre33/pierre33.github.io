    <p>
        <p>
            In the frame of my Ph.D., I decide to develop the Large Scale Region-Merging
			library. The goal of this library is to segment large satellite images which
            do not fit in the main memory. The library is still in development and may contain
            some bugs. Do not hesitate to try it for your own research and send me feedback about
            how we can improve it. Currently this library has been tested successfully for the segmentation
            of Pléiades scenes.
