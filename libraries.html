            In the frame of my Ph.D., I decide to develop the Large Scale Region-Merging
			library. The goal of this library is to segment large satellite images which
            do not fit in the main memory. The library is still in development and may contain
            some bugs. Do not hesitate to try it for your own research and send me feedback about
            how we can improve it. Currently this library has been tested successfully for the segmentation
            of Pl√©iades scenes.

        In the frame of my Ph.D., I decide to develop the Generic Region Merging
			library. The core of this library is a set of classes which describe the
			generic steps of a region merging segmentation process. The user has just
			to describe how two regions are similar and how their attributes are updated
			after a merge and that is it. What is more this library has been developed
			to be compatible to a generic tile based framework which allows to segment
			full images of arbitrary size. No more memory constraints in perspective !
