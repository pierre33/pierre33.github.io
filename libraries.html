			In the frame of my Ph.D., I decide to develop the Generic Region Merging
			library. The core of this library is a set of classes which describe the
			generic steps of a region merging segmentation process. The user has just
			to describe how two regions are similar and how their attributes are updated
			after a merge and that is it. What is more this library has been developed
			to be compatible to a generic tile based framework which allows to segment
			full images of arbitrary size. No more memory constraints in perspective !
