<h3 id="rm" class="second-title"> Region Merging </h3>
<p class="explanation">
Region merging algorithms have proven to be an effective approach for image segmentation, especially for OBIA (Object-Based Image Analysis) in remote sensing. The basic approach of a region merging algorithm is to consider at the beginning every pixel of the image as an initial region. These regions are then merged iteratively to form the objects of the image. Region merging algorithms vary depending on the criteria used to decide whether two adjacent regions have to be merged and the heuristic to find for a region its adjacent region to be merged.
<br />
Several criteria for region merging are available in the GRM Library. This section describes all of them.
