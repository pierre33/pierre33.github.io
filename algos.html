<p class="leading">
Passionated by algorithmic and programming, I decided to create a section where I can
share my thoughts on some algorithmic case studies. The objective will be for each problem
to minimize the running time and the memory complexity. I really think that the funniest 
part is the investigation of the most elegant solution. Of course I do not pretend
to find the best solution but I just want to share my reasonning and hence, I really
invite you to send me a <a href="contact.html">message</a> by proposing me your solution.
After checking, it will be a pleasure to mention it in this site with your name or
even better your website or github link.
<br/>
I hope you will have fun reading it !
