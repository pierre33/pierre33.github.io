<h1>Pierre Lassalle</h1>

<p class="lead">
	I am currently preparing a Ph.D. at the Centre National d'Ã‰tudes
	Spatiales (French Space Agency) in Toulouse in France where
	I am performing research on the processing of large remote sensing
	images. My research focuses mainly on the scalability of
	segmentation and classification algorithms for large multitemporal
	series of high resolution images.
