				I am currently preparing a Ph.D. at the Centre National d'Études
				Spatiales (French Space Agency) in Toulouse in France where
				I am performing research on the processing of large remote sensing
				images. My research focuses mainly on the scalability of
				segmentation and classification algorithms for large multitemporal
				series of high resolution images.
