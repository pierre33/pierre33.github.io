	I am currently with the Centre National d'Ã‰tudes
	Spatiales (French Space Agency) preparing a Ph.D. where
	I am performing research on the processing of large remote sensing
	images. My research focuses mainly on the scalability of
	segmentation and classification algorithms for large multitemporal
	series of high resolution images.
