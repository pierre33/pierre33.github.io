<h3>Pierre Lassalle</h3>
<p class="leading">
I am currently preparing a Ph.D. at the Centre National d'Ã‰tudes
Spatiales (French Space Agency) in Toulouse in France where
I am performing research on the processing of large remote sensing
images. My research focuses mainly on the scalability of
segmentation and classification algorithms for large multitemporal
series of high resolution images.
