				I am currently preparing a Ph.D. at the Centre National d'Études
				Spatiales (French Space Agency) in Toulouse in France where
				I am performing research on the processing of large remote sensing
				images. My research focuses mainly on the scalability of
				segmentation and classification algorithms for large multitemporal
				series of high resolution images.
				<br />
				The goal of this site is to share my research on large scale remote
				sensing algorithms and introduce to you some of the libraries I have been developing
				so far. These libraries are in progress and the presence of some terrible bugs are possible. That is why if you have a question or if you find one of these bugs, please feel free to contact me.
