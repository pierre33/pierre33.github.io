                            A new version of the GRM library is available. The code has been tested and major modifications 
                            have been done thanks to the review of the company <a href="http://fr.atos.net/fr-fr/accueil.html">Atos</a>:
                            <ul>
                            <li>A memory bug has been corrected due to circular references with the <it>std::shared_ptr</it>.</li>
                            <li>The Contour encoder seems to contain a bug, then it has been removed and will be added later.
                                Instead each segment contains a list of its internal pixels. However, be careful since 
                                this current solution requires more memory.

                                At last but not least, the computation of the merging costs has been optimized making the algorithm
                                really more efficient (10x speedup).

                                some new functionalities. Or, even better you can commit your own extensions
                                by sending me a message with your files. After verification, it will be added.

                            In the frame of my Ph.D., I decide to develop the Large Scale Region-Merging
                            library. The goal of this library is to segment large satellite images which
                            do not fit in the main memory. The library is still in development and may contain
                            some bugs. Do not hesitate to try it for your own research and send me feedback about
                            how we can improve it. Currently this library has been tested successfully for the segmentation
                            of Pl√©iades scenes.

Processing large very high-resolution remote sensing images on resource-constrained devices is a challenging task because of the large size of these data sets. For applications such as environmental monitoring or natural resources management, complex algorithms have to be used to extract information from the images. The memory required to store the images and the data structures of such algorithms may be very high (hundreds of gigabytes) and therefore leads to unfeasibility on commonly available computers. Segmentation algorithms constitute an essential step for the extraction of objects of interest in a scene and will be the topic of the investigation in this paper. The objective of the present work is to adapt image segmentation algorithms for large amounts of data. To overcome the memory issue, large images are usually divided into smaller image tiles, which are processed independently. Region-merging algorithms do not cope well with image tiling since artifacts are present on the tile edges in the final result due to the incoherencies of the regions across the tiles. In this paper, we propose a scalable tile-based framework for region-merging algorithms to segment large images, while ensuring identical results, with respect to processing the whole image at once. We introduce the original concept of the stability margin for a tile. It allows ensuring identical results to those obtained if the whole image had been segmented without tiling. Finally, we discuss the benefits of this framework and demonstrate the scalability of this approach by applying it to real large images.
