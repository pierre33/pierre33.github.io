<h2 class="main-title">Intersection of two linked lists</h2>

<h3 id="cmake" class="second-title">Problem statement</h3>
<p>
We consider a linked list where each node has the following data structure:
<pre class="prettyprint">
	<code class="cc">
	struct ListNode
	{
		int val;
		ListNode *next;
		ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL){}
	};
	</code>
</pre>
We consider two linked lists L1 and L2. The goal is to determine if there is an intersection
between L1 and L2. The following figure represents an example of intersection of two 
linked lists.

<p>
Indeed, in this figure, both lists share the same nodes from c1 to c3.
<br/>
Given the following prototype of the function:
<pre class="prettyprint">
	<code class="cc">
	ListNode* getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB)
	</code>
</pre>
the objective is to propose an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) and a memory
complexity of O(1).
<br/>
If there is no intersection between both lists, the function must return NULL.
<br />
Finally we assume that there are no cycles in both lists.

Before delving into the reasonning, I invite you to try to solve this solution and to come back after while ;)

<h3 id="cmake" class="second-title">First reasonning</h3>
<p>
Let see the first solution that comes into mind without taking care about the requirements.
An easy solution would be for each node of a list to explore all the nodes of the other list
and test if they are equal:
<pre class="prettyprint">
	<code class="cc">
	  ListNode* getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB)
	  {
	      if(headA == NULL || headB == NULL)
	          return NULL;

	      for(ListNode * tempA = headA; tempA != NULL; tempA = tempA->next)
	      {
	          for(ListNode * tempB = headB; tempB != NULL; tempB = tempB->next)
              {
	              if(tempA == tempB)
                     return tempA;
              }
	      }
          return NULL;
	  }
	</code>
</pre>
