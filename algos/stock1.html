<h2 class="main-title">Trader: best time to buy and sell</h2>
<h3 id="cmake" class="second-title">Problem statement</h3>
<p>
Do you feel like trading today ?
<br/>
Imagine you are in a bank as a trader and your boss wants you to make the bank earn 
a lot of money. You are given an array of stock prices. The i<sup>th</sup> element
of the array corresponds to the price of a share of the stock on day i.
<br/>
You are allowed to do at most one transaction, i.e buy a share of a stock and sell it after.
<br/>
The objective is to find a solution of time complexity O(n) and memory complexity O(1) that
returns the maximum profit.
</p>
<p>
For example, let [100 5 7 34 100 2] be the prices in dollars of the stock for 6 days. If I buy a share
of the stock on day 2 and I sell it on day 5, I realize the maximum profit of 95$. The function must
return 95.
</p>
<p>
As usual, try to to find the solution and come back in a while ;)

<p>
You find it already ! Ok let compare with mine.
<br/>
The time complexity has to be linear which means that we are contrained to explore all the
prices once.
<br/>
Obviously, we first buy and then we sell. That means that we will first look for a low price
and then sell it when the price is higher (we expect a lot higher).
<br/>
We do not buy the share automatically on the day where the price is the minimum and we do not
sell the share when the price is the higher. 
<br/>
Indeed if we consider the following prices [100 5 7 34 100 2], the lower price occurs the last day and the higher price the first
day However, the best strategy consists of buying on day 2 and selling on day 5. 
</p>
<p>
The idea is to keep two variables: the current lower price of the visited days and the current maximum profit.
<br/>
Indeed, consider we have a current minimum price curr_min and a current maximum profit curr_maxprofit. When
analysing the price of the next day, we can have several possibilities. If the new price is lower than our current
lower price then this new price becomes the the current lower price and we go directly to the next day. Else, we calculate
the profit which is the difference between the new price and the current lower profit. If this new profit is higher than
our current maximum profit then this new profit becomes the current maximum profit and we go to the next day.
<br/>
Here are the steps with our previous example:
<ul>
<li>Day 1: price = 100$, curr_min = 100$, curr_maxprofit = 0$.</li>
<li>Day 2: price = 5$, curr_min = 5$, curr_maxprofit = 0$.</li>
<li>Day 3: price = 7$, curr_min = 5$, curr_maxprofit = 2$.</li>
<li>Day 4: price = 34$, curr_min = 5$, curr_maxprofit = 29$.</li>
<li>Day 1: price = 100$, curr_min = 5$, curr_maxprofit = 95$.</li>
<li>Day 1: price = 2$, curr_min = 2$, curr_maxprofit = 95$.</li>
</ul>
The function returns 95.
</p>
<p>
Let check if the solution fulfills the requirements. We visit all the prices just once.
The solution has therefore a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of prices in the array. 
We just use two temporary variables in addition to the array of prices. The solution has therefore a constant memory
complexity. 
<br/>
Ok we got it ! Our boss will be happy ;) 
</p>

<p>
As usual, you can find here the source code of the solution:
<pre class="prettyprint">
	<code class="cc">
	int maxProfit(vector&lt;int&gt; &prices) {

		if (prices.size() &lt; 2)
			return 0;

		int min = prices[0];
		int profit = 0;

		for(int i = 1; i&lt;prices.size(); i++)
		{
			if(prices[i] &lt; min)
				min = prices[i];
			else
			{
				if(prices[i] - min &gt; profit)
					profit = prices[i] - min;  
			}
		}
		return profit;
	}
	</code>
</pre>
