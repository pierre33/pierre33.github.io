<h2 class="main-title">A little reminder about recursion</h2>
<h3 id="cmake" class="second-title">Calcul of the factorial of a number</h3>
<p>
This time, we change a bit the organization of the problem and
we first recall the principle of the recursion. If you know very well
this technique then go directly to the problem statement and try to solve
it using the recursion.
</p>
<p>
    The principle of the recursion is illustrated with the calculation
    of the factorial of a number. Let see the following famous recursive
    program to calculate the factorial of a number n:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
   <code class="cc">
   int factorial(int n)
   {
        if(n=0)
            return 1;
        else
            return n * factorial(n-1);
   }
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    Let suppose than n = 5 and let see how it works:
    <ul>
        <li>5 is greater than 0 then we go to the else body and we multiply 5 by the result of the
            factorial of 4. Here we see that we call again the function, it is
            the principle of recursion. Concretely, a stack of intructions is created and at this step
            the instruction to multiply 5 by the factorial of 4 is pushed into the stack. We note
            the stack:
            <ul>
                <li>factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            4 is still greater than 0 then we push again the instruction into the stack
             <ul>
                <li>factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)</li>
                 <li>factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            3 is still greater than 0 then we push again the instruction into the stack
             <ul>
                <li>factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)</li>
                 <li>factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)</li>
                 <li>factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            2 is still greater than 0 then we push again the instruction into the stack
             <ul>
                 <li>factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1)</li>
                 <li>factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)</li>
                 <li>factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)</li>
                 <li>factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            1 is still greater than 0 then we push again the instruction into the stack
             <ul>
                 <li>factorial(1) = 1 * factorial(0)</li>
                 <li>factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1)</li>
                 <li>factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)</li>
                 <li>factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)</li>
                 <li>factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            1 is equal to 0 then we push 1 into the stack
             <ul>
                 <li>factorial(0) = 1</li>
                 <li>factorial(1) = 1 * factorial(0)</li>
                 <li>factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1)</li>
                 <li>factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)</li>
                 <li>factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)</li>
                 <li>factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    This step is called the top-down execution and represents the first step of the recursion. The second step
    consists of the bottow-up execution and returns the final result by unstacking the intructions:
    <ul>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>1*1</li>
        <li>2*1*1</li>
        <li>3*2*1*1</li>
        <li>4*3*2*1*1</li>
        <li>5*4*3*2*1*1</li>
    </ul>
    which returns 120.
</p>
<p>
    Recursion in programming may be a very elegant way to solve some problems and turns out to be efficient
    provided that the depth of the recursion is not important. In this situation, the number of intructions in the stack
    can be large and it may be impossible to store it in memory. Recursion has to be used with caution.

<h2 class="main-title">Is this integer a palindrome ?</h2>
<h3 id="cmake" class="second-title">Problem statement</h3>
<p>
Write a function using recursion to determine if an integer is a palindrome. For example 123 is not a palindrome
since the reverse of 123 is 321 which is not equal to 123. However 13931 is a palindrome since the reverse of 13931 is still 13931.
</p>

<h3 id="cmake" class="second-title">Reasonning step</h3>
<p>
    The key is to determine how we can transform this problem into a two-phase strategy: top-down and bottom-up execution.
    If we take the number 13931, the logical idea is to compare the first digit with the last, the second with the one before
    the last and so on...
    <br/>
    If for a comparison, there is no equality then we stop and return false else we keep going.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    How to compare the first digit with the last one ?
    <br/>
    To get the last digit, it is pretty simple since we just have to consider the rest of the division of the number by 10:
    1 = 1393*10 + 1. 
    <br/>
    But, How to get the first digit ?
    <br/>
    The solution that comes into mind is to divise the integer successively by 10 until we reach the first digit. The problem
    is that we have to record also the last digit to compare it with the first digit.
</p>
<p>
    The recursive program will use two variables: a copy of the integer that will be successively divided by 10 in a the top down 
    execution while keeping a reference to the initial integer constant. The top down execution stops when the copy value is just one digit.
    <br/>
    The bottom-up execution consists of successively dividing the reference value by 10. Then the rest of the division
    by 10 of the reference value is compared with the rest of the division by 10 of the copy value stored in the stack
    during the top-down execution.
</p>
<p>
    Let see the stack of the solution for the number 13931. We create first the copy value noted cv = 13931 and the reference
    value noted rv = 13931. We denote func(cv, rv) our recursive function. Please note that in C++ a reference can be seen
    like a constant pointer.
</p>
<p>
    The top-down execution:
    <ul>
        <li>cv is not one digit then we call func(cv/10, rv) and we store in the stack cv and rv:
            <ul>
                <li>cv = 13931 and rv = 13931</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>cv = 1393 and is not one digit then we call func(cv/10, rv) and we store in the stack cv and rv:
            <ul>
                <li>cv = 1393 and rv = 13931</li>
                <li>cv = 13931 and rv = 13931</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>cv = 139 and is not one digit then we call func(cv/10, rv) and we store in the stack cv and rv:
            <ul>
                <li>cv = 139 and rv = 13931</li>
                <li>cv = 1393 and rv = 13931</li>
                <li>cv = 13931 and rv = 13931</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>... so on ...</li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>cv = 13 and rv = 13931</li>
                <li>cv = 139 and rv = 13931</li>
                <li>cv = 1393 and rv = 13931</li>
                <li>cv = 13931 and rv = 13931</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
At this step we have cv = 1 and rv = 13931. We compare the rest of the division by 10 of the rv with cv and check
if they are equal. If not we stop the recursion and return false else we start the bottom-up execution.
</p>
<p>
    The bottom-up execution consists of dividing value pointed by rv by 10 and compare the rest with the rest of the
    division by 10 of the value cv. Both cv and the reference rv are unstacked:
    <ul>
        <li>rf = 13931/10, cv = 13 compare 1393 % 10 with 13 % 10</li>
        <li>rf = 1393/10, cv = 139 compare 139 % 10 with 139 % 10</li>
        <li>rf = 139/10, cv = 1393 compare 13 % 10 with 1393 % 10</li>
        <li>rf = 13/10, cv = 13931 compare 1 % 10 with 13931 % 10</li>
    </ul>
    Yes !!! 13931 is a palindrome ;)
</p>
<p>
    We have just to code it. Well actually it is maybe the most difficult part.
    <br/>
    As usual, below my proposed solution but try to code it by yourself ;)
</p>
    
<pre class="prettyprint">
   <code class="cc">
    bool oneDigit(int num)
    {
    	return (num >=0 && num < 10);
    }
    
    bool isPalRecursive(int copynum, int& refnum)
    {
    	// Stop condition of the recursive method
    	// we compare the last digit of num which is refnum % 10
    	// and the first digit of num given by copynum
    	if(oneDigit(copynum))
    		return (copynum == (refnum % 10));
    
    	// If copynum is not one digit we call recursively
    	// the method isPalRecursive and we stop if it returns false.
    	if(!isPalRecursive(copynum/10, refnum))
    		return false;
    
    	refnum /= 10;
    
    	return (copynum % 10 == refnum % 10);
    }

    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
    	if(x < 0)
    		return false;
    
    	return isPalRecursive(x, x);
    }
